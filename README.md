Financial Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT

Sentiment analysis:
Sentiment analysis extracts subjective information from text to determine whether the content expresses positive, negative, or neutral opinions. In finance, news sentiment can:

Predict short-term price movements
Complement technical analysis
Identify market regime changes
Provide early warning signals

FinBERT Model:
FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model specifically fine-tuned on financial text. Unlike general sentiment models, it understands financial jargon and context (e.g., "beat earnings" is positive, "missed guidance" is negative).
